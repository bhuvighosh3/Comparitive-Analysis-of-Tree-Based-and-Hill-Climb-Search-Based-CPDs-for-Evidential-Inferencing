# Comparitive-Analysis-of-Tree-Based-and-Hill-Climb-Search-Based-CPDs-for-Evidential-Inferencing

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of postnatal depression using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), focusing on comparing Tree-Based and Hill Climb Search-Based Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs). The goal is to understand and predict the risk factors associated with postnatal depression using Bayesian Network modeling.

## Key Features
- **Implementation of Bayesian Networks** for modeling postnatal depression factors.
- **Comparison** between Tree-Based and Hill Climb Search methods.
- **Variable elimination** and inference techniques.
- **Comprehensive analysis** of conditional probabilities.
- **Performance evaluation** using accuracy metrics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises records collected from a medical hospital related to postpartum depression. Key attributes include:

- Timestamp
- Age
- Feeling sad or tearful
- Irritable towards baby & partner
- Trouble sleeping at night
- Problems concentrating or making decisions
- Overeating or loss of appetite
- Feeling anxious (target attribute)
- Feeling of guilt
- Problems of bonding with baby
- Suicide attempt
